# `DOSKEY` macros for the Windows command prompt

A simple set of unix-like and helpful macros for dealing with the Windows command prompt.

## Installation

Copy doskey.mcr to your user profile (`%USERPROFILE%` in Run or command prompt) and run doskey.reg, which will add the macro file as an auto run on your command prompt.

## Usage
* `~`: Go to your user profile directory
* `clear`: clear the screen
* `fn`: search recursively through the current directory and its subdirectories
* `ls`: run `dir` in a vaguely unix-like way (and get a message from Steve)
* `x`: shortcut to exit

There are also some `git` shortcuts. Make sure `git` is in your path.
